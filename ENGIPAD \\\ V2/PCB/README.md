# the old pcb sucked so i remade it
CHANGES!!!!!!!
* revamped RGB, now with more flashy lights and actually fixed footprints/wiring
* optional encoder, for if you want to replace the decorational rocker switch with something more functional or if you wanna ditch the case entirely
* fixed OLED footprint, now supports direct soldering to the board (idk how i messed this up the first time lmfao)
