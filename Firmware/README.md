# hello welcome to da firmware store
FYI, This firmware is using QMK! <br/>
Right now, the keymap is fully set up, with the OLED displaying "engineer gamin" and the RGB set to a pre-made RGB pattern. I plan to remake and fine tune the OLED and RGB once the parts come in, but this will do for now :3 <br/>
