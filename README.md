# EngiPad - The Construction PDA Macropad
This is a 8-key Hackpad with RGB lighting and an integrated OLED display in the case, modeled after the Engineer's PDA from *Team Fortress 2*. <br/>

The idea came a couple days ago, when I was scrolling through the TF2 wiki and noticed that the PDA would make for a *fire* macropad. I had extra time on hand and was waiting for the parts to come in for my main project, [The Biblically Accurate Keyboard](https://github.com/hunkegg/biblicallyaccuratekeyboard), so I decided to go ahead and try to speedrun designing an actual macropad this time. <br/>
I aimed to be as game accurate as possible, using pictures and screenshots from the game to model and render my case. <br/>

Speaking of the Engineer, I made my macropad work with my custom keybinds for Fusion 360, making tools that I often use like Project and Move more accessible to me while I work on engineering and CAD projects.

Made as part of Hackpad! (and the design competition due in like 4 days lmfao)

**Features**
* 8 keys binded to my most used Fusion 360 commands
* OLED display and RGB
* Custom case and keycaps modeled after the Engineer's Construction PDA
* An alternate CAD file to fit a metal toggle switch I have on hand
* QMK firmware
* TF2 inspired silkscreen on the front and Highway silkscreen on the back
