# EngiPad - The Construction PDA Macropad
This is a 8-key Hackpad with RGB lighting and an integrated OLED display in the case, modeled after the Engineer's PDA from *Team Fortress 2*. <br/>

The idea came a couple days ago, when I was scrolling through the TF2 wiki and noticed that the PDA would make for a *fire* macropad. I had extra time on hand and was waiting for the parts to come in for my main project, [The Biblically Accurate Keyboard](https://github.com/hunkegg/biblicallyaccuratekeyboard), so I decided to go ahead and try my hand at designing an actual macropad this time. <br/>



Made as part of Hackpad! (and the design competition due in like 4 days lmfao)
